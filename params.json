The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.\r\n\r\n#### DEFINITIONS\r\n“Font Software” refers to the set of files released by the Copyright Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such.
