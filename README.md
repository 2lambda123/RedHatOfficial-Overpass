## Building

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you particularly want to build fonts manually on your own computer, you will need to install the [`yq` utility](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq). On OS X with Homebrew, type `brew install yq`; on Linux, try `snap install yq`; if all else fails, try the instructions on the linked page.

Then:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.
